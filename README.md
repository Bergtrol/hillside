# Redwood Keyboard

This split choc-spaced board has the aggressive stagger of the Ferris but a longer thumb arc and a break-off outer pinky column. It uses a reversible PCB that is 98 x 137mm.

It has a few extras: encoder support under each ring finger, a header for haptic feedback, mount points for hand wiring a trackball and a bit of underglow from SK6812-MINI-Es.

I wanted a key or so more than the Ferris and an outer pinky option, so I designed a PCB instead of tweaking the choc corne, though it grew a little in that footprint....

# Why

I wanted an aggressive stager 3x6+3 with choc spacing and switches, so moving around the switches of the Choc Corne seemed the easiest approach. Yet learning more than blind KiCad modification seemed a better idea, so I started a new PCB matching the Ferris column and thumb spacing.

I liked the bottom row keys of my Atreus, so I added two under the middle columns, where they seem unobtrusive. Then one shifted to the thumb arch, which seems more versatile. An upper thumb key seemed useful and combo-able; two there looked bulky in something 'small'. It has more keys than my initial idea, but that makes keymap evolution feel less tight.

It is like a Choc Ferris on steroids, which looks close to a Choc Kyria.
