## Haptic
Add some electrical tape to the right of the the MCU, as the 0.1.0 board has the mount hole too close to the MCU pins, so a metal mounting spacer might short between them. Put the header pins loosely into the haptic board, then secure with the standoff and screws, the header pins should align easily with the PCB holds and are easy to solder with about the right bit sticking up on each end.
