## Tradeoffs
- The board edge is not as tight as it could be to the outer thumb arc. Adjustment of the thumb arc seemed likely on a personal basis, so leaving the board profile at the outer limit of the arc would provide a consistent shape for creating a case. And a smaller arc would fit in a slightly larger case.

## Hotswap keys and PCBA
I'm conflicted on adding these.

PCBA would make assembly less tedious. But for a single person ordering from the factory, a minimum order of five boards means 2.5x of what was needed, which is not too bad. A non reversible board means 5x of what was needed, which seems excessive.

Hotswap would make salvaging keys from old boards easier, and creating a PCBA board _much_ easier. Yet I need to look at how much they raise the board.
