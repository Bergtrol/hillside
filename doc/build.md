# Building
Several great guides of the typical build steps exist:
- [Lily58](https://github.com/Keycapsss/Lily58L-Build-Guide/blob/master/)
- [Kyria](https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010552059-Kyria-Build-Guide-Introduction)

I'll focus here on comments unique to this design.

- All the components go on the top side, so labeling that with a bit of tape might be a good idea.

- A good first step is the LEDs as they are susceptible to damage during soldering.

- The MCU goes face down on both halves, with components toward the board.
