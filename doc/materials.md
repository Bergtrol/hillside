# Optional

## Board Hardware

The simplest use is flat on a desk, for which some small silicon feet will keep the pin bottoms and your desk separate. You can also add LEDs for visual feedback. As insurance against a damaged MCU bricking half of the keyboard, you can socket each MCU.

## Haptic Feedback

If you'd like tactile feedback of keypresses or modes, you can mount a haptic board above the MCU.

## Tenting Hardware

Tenting the halfs can make things much more ergonomic. You can do that with a book, some wood, or with a tenting puck and more sophisticated camera mounting components.
