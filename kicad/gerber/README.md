These PTH are mechanical not electrical:

- Four 2.2mm in the center, for a tenting puck.
- Three 2.5mm on the right, for haptic and trackball boards. 
- Two 1.3mm on the right, for a reset switch.
- One 1.7mm in the bottom center, for a keyswitch that is also a rotary encoder mount. It is close to a the ground PTH for the rotary encoder, so it got converted to a PTH. Some joining of the two is fine.
