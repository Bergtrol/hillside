# Interim Firmware Access

While Hillside is being integrated into QMK,
  the enclosed hillside folder contains the needed QMK firmware files.
Copy it into your local QMK repository as
  qmk_firmware/keyboards/handwired/hillside.

For ZMK, see [Hillside ZMK Firmware](https://github.com/mmccoyd/zmk-config).
